Well shit, that's proper shit that is. But there was one last hope! Lousid! Hopefully he's in a better mood and ready to salvage this night! With unmatched optimism Butters raps their knuckles on the door “Oh Louuussiidddd” they call out, as the door opens...
―Hey Butters, how’s it going?
Says a familiar Tanuki as their head pops out of the door, followed by a Kitsune above them. It was Sebastian and ‘Uke, Lousid’s partners. Followed by Lousid himself poking his head underneath them complete with a ballgag.
Butters paused for a few seconds, inhaling and exhaling deeply.
