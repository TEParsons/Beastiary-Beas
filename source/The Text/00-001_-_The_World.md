The 14th stroke of Georgian’s shortest
All I can do is wonder if you’re doing it too?
Recreating snapshots of 8 years hence
In public transit daydreams, during the afternoon’s hue

I must confess I time travel every single time
To the moonlight pouring down the arc of your back
As all communicative functions start to fail me
For all my bravado, I need your help picking up the slack

It’s the perfect antidote to a year in the crosshairs
Suddenly I feel my claws recede into myself
Like I could camouflage into the decor
For just one night, we’re just another pair of lovers
Instead the centrepiece of a wallflower exhibition
Locked into your thighs; finally some peace and quiet
Pacified by temporary humanity
What I would’ve give for the reunion tour

On this day of Saint Valentines~

---------------------------------------------------

It's funny how the mind remembers the most significant events that have happened to it, even if the person behind it does everything in their power to forget. Recollections of instances that agitate the body's sensations, it'll relentlessly grasp onto them and recall them endlessly, without hesitation.

The scent of the car leather

The chill of the night

The drone of the street lights

Their floorboards creaking as you tiptoe on them

A finger stroking the fur of the back of your hands

Up and down

The sensation that lingers even after the hand has been removed

Catching the alcohol scent on your breath

The blast of sauce on the makeshift pasta the morning after

The chill of the morning

Slowly letting go of your paw

It's that time of year again...

You could go over this forever if could

But the jeering of the 79 robs you of any further time with this compilation.
